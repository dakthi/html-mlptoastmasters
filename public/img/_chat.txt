I hope your weekend is going well.

Please let's get into  the habit of allocating  workbook assignments to the speeches we give on Easy Speak.

We have past speeches that are missing workbook assignments for three previous meetings.

Without workbook assignments allocated to these speeches, I am unable to open our next meeting on the 29th for people to take on roles.

I have messaged the relevant persons.

Can this please be done by the end of today.

Many thanks for your assistance.

[22/07/2025, 09:47:27] Thi: To clarify:
toastmastersclub.org is Easyspeak website 

*toastmasters.org is the official Toastmasters International website and we should be logging into this regularly! to work through our speeches on our Pathway via Basecamp. This is the official Toastmasters website and we plan our speeches and tick them off when done here.* Our speech progress needs t be recorded here to count. There are also all the resources and dashboard here for our committee to access.

Easyspeak isn't an official Toastmasters website but is how we plan all our club meetings.

Congrats to the club on its anniversary 👏
[17/09/2025, 13:48:12] ~ Hanah: Sorry I missed! 
But this seems like a great idea
[20/09/2025, 13:49:21] ~ Shankari: Hello everyone,
As contest season is round the corner....Wanted to ask whether a everyone would be available to take up the role of voting judge on Tuesday 23rd september at london toastmasters at 6pm.Please do.connect with me if you would.be available.
[21/09/2025, 21:20:34] ~ Shankari: Hello everyone,
As you guys know contest season is around the corner.And we have the humorous and table topic contest on 30th september.Kindly reach out to me for taking up the following roles:
1.Contest chair(2) 
2.Tally counter (2)
3.Timers(2)
Kindly note you can take up the roles only if you are not participating in the contest.
Kindly reach out to me as soon as possible.
[22/09/2025, 13:11:41] ~ Nick Ronald: *Do you need to renew your club membership?*

It is now renewals time, so some of you will need to renew your club membership from now (Sept) until March to 2026. I think it is only £40 with the current conversion rate. So, fantastic value.

All you have to do is login to Toastmasters International (www.toastmasters.org) and click on 'Self-pay'. There will be a message displayed if you need to renew and a link to self pay.

It is quick and easy. Once done, that's it, you have another six months membership of our great club.

If you need any help with renewing your membership, then of course let me know or you can message @⁨~Shankari⁩ as VP-Membership.
[22/09/2025, 14:11:51] ~ GT: Paid the best money I'll spend this year ! 

Comes up in $ for me dont know why, but all gone through.
[22/09/2025, 14:18:34] ~ Nick Ronald: *A huge well done to Grant 👏👏 to be the first person (after me of course) to renew & his excellent point - that it will be the best money you spend this year...….* 🎉

This shows how quick and easy it is to do. The renewal amount does show in dollars, I presume as Toastmasters is an American organisation. However, this is great news for us as 10 dollars is only £7 for us. So, the price in dollars is much less when converted to pounds. Fantastic value for six months of speeches, inspiration, training, learning & personal development, get togethers and social time.

*Who will be next to renew????* 🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
